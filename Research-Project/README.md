1\. Introduction
================

Data visualization helps to understand data and the knowledge behind it by its visual appearance. This helps to understand the data significance and to help business with the result of patterns and correlation in data, for example, through representing data in the form of charts and graphs.

As of Big data era, there are data visualization tools available in the market that out-performs with features like infographics, dials and gauges, geographic maps, sparklines, heat maps, and detailed bar, pie and fever charts compared to traditional tools, like Microsoft Excel. These features include good interactions with users/customers, can be manipulated for the analytical and querying purpose required for any business cases.

2\. Importance of Data visualization
====================================

Data visualization has become the actual standard for contemporary business intelligence (BI). The success of the visualization leading vendor, Tableau has affected alternative vendors toward a lot of visual approach in their package, nearly all visualization package has robust information for real-time practical use cases. Data visualization tools are necessary for democratizing information and analytics and creating data-driven insights out there to employees throughout a corporation. They're usually easier to work than anciently applied math analysis package or earlier versions of the software.

Data visualization package conjointly plays a crucial role in massive information and advanced analytics as businesses accumulated large troves of knowledge throughout the first years of the large data trend, they required the simplest way to quickly get a summary of their information. Visualization is central to advanced analytics for similar reasons, once a technical person is writing advanced prognosticative analytics or machine learning algorithms, it becomes necessary to visualise the outputs to observe results and make sure that models are performing simulations as meant, this is often as a result of visualizations of advanced algorithms are usually easier to interpret than numerical outputs.

8\. Advantages of using Tableau
=============================

Great Visualizations: with a huge amount of data that can be homogeneous or heterogeneous can create a variety of visualizations. Tableau built-in functions can create such visualizations that surely is out of the box. Additionally, Tableau has an option to switch between various visualizations that result to bring about a business context, different ways to drill down data, and exploring the data at a smaller level.

Broad Insights: Tableau can help organisations to analyze future predictable data without any specific goals, can visually explore at the same data from a different perspective. This is helpful when one needs to work on 'what if' queries and work with that result data by visualizing it in various angles and spontaneously adding features for comparison purposes and analysis. This capability is a great feature in Tableau along with real-time data.

User-friendly: Biggest strength of Tableau as it is built from the base level for people who don't have any technical background or any prior set of skills. So, almost everything can be developed with this tool. Since developing each visual representation of dashboards and charts can be created by drag-and-drop. This feature is said to be so intuitive and self-depicting.

9\. Analytics on AWS with Tableau
================================

There are several big data instances happening around the world like data is created in the last two years is of more than 90%; over 1.8MB of new information is being created per second; the yearly growth rate is over 55% surpassing billions by 2020;etc, in order to control such a huge amount of data, there should be a place for Big data technologies that should work faster and effective than the traditional information technologies. Amazon Web Services(AWS) is an emerging cloud computing platform from Amazon. It has an infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS) and AWS for Big data has available features like:

-   Availability

-   Capability

-   Security

-   Scalability

It is an hassle-free process to work with data AWS where the data is securely stored and no commitment to analyse with any choice of engine. Additionally, AWS is a complete Big data platform by which users/professionals can:

-   Built big data repositories

-   Perform streaming analysis

-   Create Offload ETL

-   Machine learning

-   Ad servicing

-   Use Business intelligence applications

Along with Tableau, AWS can be widely used at the enterprise level for the following two business purposes:

-  Business analytics: Databases can connect directly from Tableau desktop

-  Business visualization: Tableau servers can host on EC2

Below is the model architecture that depicts Tableau + AWS integration.

-  **Raw data**: Â data is collected from various data sources and in different available formats and stores them in their original formats

-  **Collect/Store**: in this phase helps to negate the capacity constraints and creates storage and consumptions space for the required data. The benefit of this phase is "pay for what is used".

-  **Store/Analyze**: Support different use cases with the same platform. Easy to access, easy to share.

-  **Data warehouse and analysis**: Connect and analyze in minutes. Share insight with anyone securely

<a name="10"/>

10\. Tableau + AWS Customer Use case
==================================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) can be combined with Tableau to create a powerful cloud analytics platform. Every step of the the analytics pipeline including Â data collection, transformation, storage and analysis can be performed at enterprise scale with AWS and Tableau products. We present use-cases where businesses have successfully developed cloud and big data analytics platforms using AWS and Tableau. It must be noted that there is no "one size fits all" when it comes to architectures to perform successful cloud and big data analytics. Different companies tailor solutions to address the evolving needs of their businesses.

-   **Netflix**: Netflix needed to expand its data capabilities to support handling more than one-third of all internet traffic. More than 700 billion rows of data are generated by netflix users watching and rating movies and television shows on a daily basis. As a consequence, governance and scalability were at the top priorities when determining the requirements for Netflix's analytics solution. Streaming tools like Kafka, as well as big data processors like Hive, Hadoop, and Presto feed data into Amazon S3 for the Netflix's analytics platform. Thereafter, the data is sent to Amazon Redshift and Teradata before being eventually aggregated into Tableau Hyper Extracts. This enables the collection and storage of massive amounts of data to eventually provision and govern data obtained from a wide range of users. For example, since nearly 200 countries use Netflix, different country managers need to easily maintain the programming for the respective audiences. Â The Tableau Server administrator applies permissions at the group and individual level to ensure this. Netflix's extensive analytics platform built on the AWS and Tableau provides an excellent example for organizations looking to build scalable and flexible business intelligence in the cloud.

-   **Expedia Group**: Instead of being stuck in the process of creating pivot tables in Excel, analysts at Expedia wanted to empower their stakeholders to conduct their own self-service analysis and dive deeper into critical business questions to get analytical insights. Further, they required a fully managed cloud analytics solution that could scale and evolve on-demand. To this end, AWS was able to provide a permanent and scalable architecture components. Also, Tableau Online provided an easy-to-use analytics platform that helped stakeholders answer questions with data quickly, irrespective of their data skills. Expedia uses services like AWS Data Pipeline to automate the transfer and transformation of its data into Amazon Redshift, which then feeds data directly into Tableau. By partitioning data custodians to their respective secure folders in Tableau Online, Expedia is able to to manage permissions and users with little lead times. Tableau also Â helps automatically manages version upgrades and perform maintenance. The launch of Tableau Online's West Coast data center on AWS helped further accentuate benefits of Tableau for Expedia and other organisations with data sources in the region. Tableau and AWS helped Expedia in saving time for its analysts and customers, making data more accessible while maintaining scalability helping Expedia meet the growing business needs.

-   **Sysco**: Sysco were challenged by a variety of problems including large and disparate data, inconsistencies in reporting, long lead times, increasing cost of ownership and issues with scalability. As a consequence, they undertook an enterprise-wide transformation. The organisation wanted to scale up to meet evolving business needs and provide a foundation for data governance and data security across the organisation. By using Tableau on AWS, Sysco was able to implement "Sysco Ecosystem for Enterprise Data" (SEED) to store and manage its data and quickly create sandbox environments for experimentation. Sysco is able to leverage catalog and ETL capabilities for its data by using services like AWS Glue, while moving it to a new data lake on Amazon S3 Storage. Further, Amazon EMR helps to efficiently process the huge amounts of data coming in from Sysco's ecosystem. This leads to reduction in costs and complexity, ultimately leading to a smooth, direct connection to Tableau via Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena. Sysco could now easily set up an experience for ad-hoc analysis across multiple functions like marketing, merchandising and revenue management. With Tableau usage jumping from 64 users to over 12,000, the SEED initiative has dramatically changed with how data is visualised and understood at Sysco.

-   **Edmunds.com** : At Edmunds, a traditional reporting process that was difficult to scale stood in the way of business users who wanted more answers from their data. They chose to use AWS and Tableau as a scalable, cost-effective data infrastructure that could enable self-service analytics. They started by the migrating their website and back-end systems to AWS. By using Tableau Server and Amazon Redshift, Edmunds has built a data warehousing and analytics solution where users can query its data with speed and agility to gain important data insights and drive better business outcomes. AWS and Tableau offer Edmunds data democratization and a scalable infrastructure to support its growing needs for data management and analytics.

-   **Pearson** : Pearson provides a range of teaching and learning products and services including educational courseware and assessment tools. Faced with the challenges of scalability and costs from legacy data platforms, Pearson turned to Tableau on AWS to establish a modern cloud-based data analytics platform. Now, Pearson's data flows from their on-premises data platform and third party data sources into Amazon S3. Pearson enabled stream processing and intelligent routing capabilities for disparate, real-time data using Amazon Kinesis. Further, by using Â Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift to set up native connections from Tableau to their data, it became possible for users to perform ad-hoc analysis, discovery, and monitoring, thereby enabling operational insights. Pearson's analytics platform with Tableau on AWS allows the organization to effectively and efficiently scale as its data strategy and user community evolve.

**Q75: How long have you been working on this session? What have been the main difficulties you have faced and how have you solved them?**
We've worked on this lab for 12 hours. We faced some difficulty initially in understanding how and where to obtain relevant data/fields from the Page Source of the web-pages and learning the syntax of css/xpath queries. We ran into some problems while configuring ElasticSearch and Kibana, particularly in setting the correct EASTIC_API environment variables.
